STM32 SD Card Interfacing with Example â€“ STM32F103C8T6 Blue Pill Board</br>
In This project, we are going to Interface the SD card with STM32 (STM32 SD Card) using SPI communication. In this demo, we have used the STM32F103C8T6 Blue Pill board. You can also try this method with other STM32 boards.</br>
